          “We are here to have fun, we will go through roller coasters and
          roller coasters and roller coasters. I am not getting out of it.” Said
          Olster ( a deadly looking boy with brown hairs, large eyes, large ear
          rings, near around 24) with deadly excitement. <br />
          “First let’s eat something.” Said Rover( a really handsome boy, with
          sharp face, black dark eyes and dark silky hairs which reached just
          about his shoulders, same age aas Olster), asked and looked around.
          <br />
          “ Okay! What shall we eat?” Asked Natella( with long hairs, river
          colour blue eyes and two pretty ear rings in her ears that made her
          more beautiful, around 20 years), <br />
          “ Burgers! Burgers! Burgers!” Olster started shouting, <br />
          <img

            class="gifs2"
          />
          <br />
          “Okay! Okay! Burger it is then.” replied Rover. <br />
          “Who is giving the treat?” asked Natella, <br />
          They both started laughing on her like she was a girl of ten years
          old, she started feeling embarrassed, she asked with angry voice,
          <br />
          <img
            src="https://c.tenor.com/6OtTMs2m7t0AAAAM/what-so-funny-vinny.gif"
            class="gifs2"
          />
          <br />
          Rover shushed Olster and told her with deep voice, “It’s your first
          time, don’t worry you will see soon.” <br />
          They walked for a while and stood 40 meters away from the burger shop,
          <br />
          “Why did we stopped?” asked Natella, <br />
          Rover pointed on a boy sitting on a table quietly eating a burger
          facing the other side, but something was strange. He had a pile of
          burgers in front of him,
          <br />
          “ Is he gonna eat them all?” She asked with curiosity, <br />
          “ Well, no, he bought it for us.” Olster said and started running.
          <br />
          <img

            class="gifs2"
          />
          <br />
          “ Why is he running like that?” She made a disgusted face and asked,
          <br />
          “Just watch!” Rover kept his hand on her shoulder and started to wait
          with excitement, Olster reached that boy’s desk and stole two burgers,
          and started laughing like a maniac while running. <br />
          <img
            src="https://c.tenor.com/qeXLwt-fFmcAAAAM/willem-dafoe-maniacal-laugh.gif"
            class="gifs2"
          />
          <br />
          They both made confused faces and looked at each other, <br />
          “Well that wasn’t supposed to happen.” Said Rover, she looked at him
          with angry face, and said with bored voice, <br />
          “Then what was supposed to happen?”
          <br />
          He came in front of her and said softly, this was supposed to happen,
          he started moving slowly and stylishly and approached him and asked
          that boy for two burgers, and he accepted the request and gave him
          three burgers instead of two, he gently said, <br />
          "Thank you" <br />
          And picked up the glass of coke and poured it all on him. He came back
          near Natella without saying a word, and gave her two burgers. <br />
          “And what’s that supposed to mean, there was no fun in this.” She
          asked with tired voice. <br />
          “Nothing, just wait for next week, we come here every week, and now as
          you are part of team and more my girlfriend, you will be with us every
          week”. He unwrapped his burger and ate a huge bite. Natella looked at
          him again and started to think for a second, she half unwrapped her
          burger. But suddenly Olster came from behind and scared her, she
          dropped the burger on the the dirty floor which was traded by at least
          thousands foots a step. But, that does not seem to be a big problem
          for Olster, <br />
          " See, you dropped it." He picked up the burger blew it and ate a
          large bite. <br />
          " I just saw a little mud on the side. And it is not there now." Rover
          said with disgusted face.

            class="gifs2"
          />
          <br />
          They were on the same spot, but this time Olster was having his
          burger, and strangely the boy was also sitting there with a pile of
          burgers, facing the other side, Natella still not able to see her.
          <br />
          "Is he not tired?" Asked Natella with tired voice. Olster and Rover
          laughed and said "He never gets tired." <br />
          They went near him and again asked for burgers, and he agreed easily
          and gave them four burgers. Rover and Olster picked up the cups, eight
          in number, they picked two of them and poured it on him. He was
          sitting there quietly, without reacting. Natella felt weird, but she
          also enjoyed it. She also ran there and picked up a cup and poured it
          on him. Without even seeing him. She enjoyed it very much. She looked
          at him, his eyes were closed and there was a smile on his face. <br />
          He slowly opened his eyes and said with still a smile on his face,
          "Wow! Today there are three of you." <br />
          He wiped the drink from his eyes, and openes his eyes wide open.
          <br />
          "Oh! I didn't knew you were here too." <br />
          he said. <br />
          " You know him?" Rover asked with confused voice. Natella was
          stupified,

            class="gifs2"
          />
          <br />
          " I dont know him!" She ran away.
