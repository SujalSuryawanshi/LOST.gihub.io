          “ Hello everyone, I am Tom Refalss. I am 16 and head boy of the
          school.” Addressing the school in assembly hall. <br />
          “ Today is tenth of September, or we can say 'World Depression Day’.
          And today, I am here to inform you about depression. It’s a state of
          mind where you feel that you are alone in this world and what you are
          suffering is the worst phase of your life. But trust me it’s not!
          People have suffered even the worst and you are lucky that you have
          not been through that.” Pointing the assembly with grace and attitude
          for trying to connect with them.<br />
          <img src="https://c.tenor.com/pUzis05FRmIAAAAC/singing-americas-got-talent.gif" class="gifs3"> <br>
          “ We live to achieve! We die for a reason! Don’t change this
          theory....”<br />
          “ We live to die! We die because of pressure which is not even put by
          you on yourself, it’s put by the others because they are not impressed
          by your work and they are not satisfied with your work.” He shouted
          again,<br />
          “ So just screw them! And live your life as you want. Don’t listen to
          anyone, do what you want, but don’t hurt anyone.”<br />
          “ If you hurt yourself you hurt them who love you. If you hurt others
          then they are also loved by someone. So just be happy and keep people
          around you as happy as possible.” <br/>
          “ Goodbye, we will meet soon again.” Walking off the stage with a
          happy heart after hearing a great round of applause from the
          audience.<br />
          “ Great speech!” Everyone praising Tom and shaking hands to flatter
          him more. But it was a regular job and child’s play for Tom to
          convince and win everyone’s attention and make them believe that what
          he is saying, he has suffered through it a lot and is sharing his own
          experience. <br />
          But Tom has never faced depression in his life and he always lived a
          very good life, his scores were good, his image in teachers and
          between everyone was also good, he never harmed or troubled anyone, so
          not a soul existed who was having trouble with him, everyone felt
          happy and safe around him. Because he never caused any trouble, well
          enough of his appreciation let’s move forward.<br />
          And his father made his day better, he bought half of the school,
          because he wanted to make some changes there and slowly he wanted to
          buy that whole school.<br />
          So, after giving the speech Tom was on his way back home, riding the
          skateboard, he was skating like surfers surf in the ocean. <br>
          <img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/xT0BKEHQpYKQ5aDcgE/giphy.gif" class="gifs3"> <br> 
          But suddenly a cat appeared out of nowhere, he jumped from the board, his board
          was on one side and he flew overhead the cat in order to save her. He
          flew in an arc and landed barely 10 inch away from the cat, he rolled
          on the road like a ball. He stopped eventually after few rounds but he
          was all covered with blood, he was in trouble but it was a deserted
          road. <br />
          No one could see him neither he could call for help because he was in
          deep pain that he couldn’t even utter a word. So he did what everyone
          do when they are in trouble. He…. He……<br />
          “ Called for help.” <br />
          He called his sister to rescue him.<br />
          Oh! Did I forgot to mention about her? Well, we have just started. So
          Tom has a sister and her name is Elizabeth Refalss, she is a good
          singer and a phone addict and a fashion queen and the most important
          thing,<br />
          “ She is selfish.” <br />
          She loves her parents, she behaves good, but she never liked her brother. She was always jealous
          because everyone in the school always praised him and she was loved by
          very less people, she just had one friend, her name was Natella. They
          are best friends in school, not just in school they are the best
          friends in the whole universe. <br />
          Wait! Tom was hurt, right? We need to get back to him. <br />
          So, Tom called his sister and as soon as she picks up, her first words
          were, <br />
          “ I am busy right now, call me later.” She was just about to hang up,
          she pulled her phone again near to her ear and spoke with attitude,<br />
          <img src="https://c.tenor.com/qciNLdVsEB8AAAAC/never-call-me-again-do-not-call.gif" class="gifs3"> <br />
          Without wasting time Tom called his friend. He picked up the phone at
          once because now he was the best friend of Tom, his name is John and
          he is a very nerdy and shy boy. He never used to talk to anyone before
          he met Tom, because he was always scared and always get panic easily
          but Tom helped him a lot in getting up and mixing with the people. So,
          he always looked towards Tom as his best friend but Tom never had best
          friend because he was more self kind of person.<br />
          Oh man! We got distracted again. So, Tom was all covered in blood and
          on ground calling John. <br />
          “ John picked his phone at once, and his first words were,<br />
          “ Sorry Tom, I am busy right now I will call you later.”<br />
          Tom lost hope, he was in blood and double was his pain but he lost
          hope a too early because before hanging up John asked Tom to
          respond<br />
          “ Tom, you heard me……..? Tom……?”<br />
          Tom struggled a lot and said just one word one time because that was
          all he could say at once…<br />
          “ Help………” <br />
          He hung up and laid on the ground, he was unconscious for a long time
          and when he woke up his blood got dried up and it stuck to his skin,
          the same cat who came in the way was licking Tom’s face.<br />
          Tom was feeling much better and could say words and could even walk.
          <br />
          When he got up, he saw the cat was repeating a pattern. She was
          rubbing her forehead on Tom’s trousers and walking in one direction,
          she was repeating this pattern again and again. Till Tom started
          following it. Tom was limping and struggling on each step but he was
          also curious to know where the cat was leading to, he looked at his
          phone it was in pieces and it broke down because when he hung up on
          John he threw his phone away because of a sudden jerk to his hands.<br />
          He started following the cat, you can easily see blood on his arms and
          can recognise that he was in pain. <br />
          When he reached the last step he stopped near a bridge, the cat also
          stopped. Tom looked around but couldn’t see anything, he then gave a
          look towards cat, he saw that cat was repeating a pattern again. She
          was looking towards Tom and then walking a few steps and looking down
          the bridge when Tom looked down the bridge and saw that a cat was
          hanging to a branch and the flow of the stream was strong enough to
          take cat away with it. <br />
          “ This has to be today, seriously?” Tom sighed and said in tired
          manner. <br />
          But he couldn’t have just left the cat there, so he decided to help
          the cat though, he was injured enough to get admitted in a hospital
          for about a week. But he was ethical and legal if this sentence makes
          sense so.<br />
          He walked away from the bridge and started climbing down from the end,
          he was scared but more confident that the stream is not strong enough
          to take him away. So, he reached the cat with a light hearted spirit
          and when he tried to reach the cat and stretched his hand. <br />
          “ He slipped!!!!!”<br />
          He slipped and fell directly in the stream, he called for help near
          about one to two times and then he soon realised that it was not deep
          enough to drown him. He quickly stood on his feet and looked around to
          see if anyone else is there who saw this embarrassing moment. He
          looked up and saw a boy, he stared at him for 5 minutes the boy stared
          him for 10 minutes and ran away. <br />
          Tom without even looking at the cat, he just calculated and grabbed it
          by one hand and left the water. And booooooom!<br />
          “ He rescued the cat.”<br />
          He started crawling on the steep surface of the borders of the bridge,
          when he reached the end, he first dropped the cat out and then hung to
          the end, he pulled himself out, he shook himself to drip water out the
          clothes.<br />
          “ What a busy day!” But, he suddenly heard a beep sound from just
          front of him, it was John with mobile phone and a police vehicle. John
          was there like this. <br>
          <img src="https://c.tenor.com/xU5o4oSq-aIAAAAM/cop-watch-camera-man.gif" class="gifs3"> <br>
          And then he shuted loudly,<br>
