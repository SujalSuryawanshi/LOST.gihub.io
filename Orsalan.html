          "We lived in the bottom of this world, we were not even allowed to look out. After a long time we are going to see the outside world. And now I am not going to take you this away for me, or everyone dies. And you know, what I mean by 'everyone'."<br> And the sound fainted with darkness. <br>

          The whole world is deserted, no one is outside. Near about everyone on the planet died because of the heat wave released by sun. It destroyed everything, every living creatures and every plants and animals. But someone predicted this a long ago, she predicted the positions of stars, and  coincidently the largest star too, she knew that if she would tell this to someone or everyone they will definitely think that she is going mad. So, she decided to keep this a secret and do her best to survive this, so she made money by telling her fact in the form of stories to the world. She, made money, and she knew exactly what to do with this. So, she made an underground world, which prevented the rays from reaching the earth, it was nearly about 278,000 square kilometers in area. How did she made such a huge civilization underground? <br>

          I am pretty sure it must have been something that made her do this so quickly and at such a big scale. To build this underground tunnel, it might take a hundred years but she was barely 23 years old. <br>
          And for some reason, she made levels inside tunnels. It was divided into 7 levels,
