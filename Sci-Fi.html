            Near about a thousand years ago, a large explosion made 4 universes.

          To expand the life of life. It replicated and replicated and
          replicated, but couldn't replicate more than 4 times. This resulted in
          making of an organism, which then multiplied again and again to create
          more life. <br />
          Oh no! I think I have made a huge mistake and I don’t know how to make
          it right! Oh! you are here I didn’t noticed. I am sorry! Don’t focus
          on that. <br />

          So, it was a normal day as always nothing was special in the date or
          day or month or year, the date was 24 September, 2020. See didn't I
          told it was a normal day. Winds were normal, pleasant voice of birds
          and voice of happiness from kids playing in the school ground, as it
          was the last day of a very boring camp. <br />
          A boy with shining eyes, emoji design on the shoes and shirt all over,
          with curly hairs and a bracelet in his hand, enjoying football with
          his friends in the play ground and roaming around girls flirting with
          them, having no sense how to talk to others and how to behave is
          Pryton, as bad as a gangster, but he was not of any use or worth of
          talking so we will go to the other boy. <br />
          A boy sitting on the bench with normal jeans and a colourful shirt,
          with normal hair not a stylish one, blonde hairs, sky blue eyes, not
          too fat neither to slim as simple as a common man is William. <br />
          He was a very smart and real person but as it is said," The more real
          you are, the less friends you have." Same was with William, he was a
          very brilliant and practical student not in the studies but in life.
          He was not brilliant in studies because his aims were different from
          others. <br />
          It was nearly noon and a bright sunny day, William was sitting on
          bench waiting for someone. The area was crowded, many kids were
          playing football in the ground, many were just standing and gossiping
          about their teachers and their friends and rest were just staring the
          opposite gender and waiting for them to talk first. William was happy
          as it was the last day of the camp and was going to start a new life
          from tomorrow, he was relaxing on the bench, his eyes were closed,
          lying like a drunk man smiling for no reason. <br />
          But suddenly drops of some liquid fell on his face, he went in a deep
          dilemma. <br />
          He thought instantly with panic face "How did it started raining in
          such a bright and sunny day?" <br />
          And when he opened his eyes, he saw that the sky was ripped into two
          parts and a rift through which stars can be seen is shining in the sky
          and the liquid fell on his face was not rain drops it was blood. He
          shouted <br />
          "Oh my god! It’s not raining! It's bloodaining!" <br />
          Chaos took place in William’s mind and heart, he started running here
          and there but suddenly an another forced stopped him, he slowly turned
          his head to see who was stopping him, but nobody was there soon he
          noticed that it's not a person who was stopping him it's the sky. He
          started shouting <br />
          "Help me! Help! Somebody help me please, the sky is not letting me
          go!" <br />
          But nobody was listening him, the time slowed down and everyone around
          him were just moving in slow speed, the water droplets of artificial
          fountain just slowed down at the speed of turtle, all the birds were
          flying at the speed of snail and the ball was just about to enter the
          goal but it slowed down too. William was barely 5 feet away from the
          goal. <br />
          He applied all his efforts as much as he could, but not to save
          himself, he applied his efforts to score the goal. But he couldn't And
          started shouting again but didn’t lasted for long, <br />
          "I can't compete with the nature." He started repeating, <br />
          "Oh god! Please forgive me and all my sins, I am coming to you please
          let me in. I am afraid from the hell, so please let me in heaven. I am
          afraid from punishments so please keep nature of forgiven. " <br />
          " If I had got some more time to live, I would have definitely wrote
          some poem." <br />
          By saying this he slowly loosed his body and went in that rift
          willingly, unknown to all the incidents that were going to take place,
          all the thrill he is going to face and all the good things going to
          happen. He kept his eyes closed for nearly an hour because he was
          scared to death, he was feeling that someone is throwing him here and
          there like basketball in court in the sky, after some time he fell
          hard on the ground and when he opened his eyes he was laying on a
          white mud field and there was no sun in the sky but sunlight was
          everywhere. He started thinking with relief, <br />
          "Finally I made it to heaven. It is so beautiful, a lot more than I
          expected. But what I am supposed to do now?" <br />
          When he sat, he saw many persons standing around him but they were not
          "person" person. They are having beautiful and clean faces, their skin
          tone was mostly like of human, colourful eyes nearly white hairs and
          all were wearing colourful clothes, each and every man was tall and
          handsome and girls were gorgeous and beautiful. <br />
          William thought in mind " Everything is so white and handsome here
          excluding me. Oh! They must be angels." <br />
          He was now sure that he is in heaven. He looked around and soon
          spotted a group of angels. <br />
          <img
            src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SpitefulWellmadeHippopotamus-max-1mb.gif"
            class="gifs"
          />
          <br />
          He started asking to the angels, "Do you know where I am going to meet
          Mr. God?" <br />
          All the angels started looking at each other. They were very confused.
          William assumed that they are not able to understand him, he starts to
          speak other language. It is not different from English, it's just an
          elongated form of English. <br />
          "Do..... youuu........ knoww........ whare......... iiisssssss........
          goooooouuuuddd...?, it's a good language I am going to name it as
          'Enlaria'. " <br />
          All the angels for a moment that William is trying to make fun of
          them. They all were making angry faces but William was not changing
          his tone of speaking, he was so excited in speaking his Enlaria, that
          he didn’t thought of the people around him. One of the angels yelled
          at him. <br />
          "Don't you know how to speak English?" he shouted in anger, <br />
          William started laughing loudly, he pat his head and said with
          humorous voice, "Stupid me." <br />
          "Yeah, we saw that at the first time." Angels answered <br />
          "You have a very good sense of humour Mr. Angel" <br />
          "You too have a very good sense of humour." Angels said casually.
          <br />
          William started crying softly. Angels thought that they must have done
          something wrong. <br />
          "What happened pal?" Angels asked <br />
          Now William started crying aloud. Angels thought they are doing
          something wrong again and again, now they didn't add any prefix or
          suffix in the sentence, they simply asked <br />
          "What happened? Have we done something?" <br />
          "Yes, you did!" William shouted <br />
          "But you have not done anything wrong you have done everything right."
          <br />
          "First you complemented that I have a good sense of humour, then you
          called me 'pal' till today not a soul has called me 'pal'." <br />
          Angels started feeling weird they whispered among each other," His
          memory must be very sharp.” <br />
          While William was crying facing on the ground by a sense of happiness
          and surprised manner, all the angels walked away without letting him
          know, he was sobbing for nearly 15 minutes. <br />
          He cracked a joke for himself after crying "Now it's not bloodaining
          too, it's tearaining. <br />
          After a long mourning and sobbing time he finally looked up with eyes
          filled with tears, he saw no one around him but when he cleaned his
          eyes he saw a very beautiful girl standing and staring at him.<br />
          Blue clothes, blonde hair, beautiful eyes as normal girls have, but
          her clothes were not normal, it was like a battle suit a gun hanging
          to a strip on the shoulder which made her more beautiful.<br />
          William was shying because not a single girl in his life starred at
          him with such an innocent and beautiful face. <br />
          William thought in his mind “It’s better to start now than waiting for
          school to reopen in my next birth." William continued “Will you
          please help me? I am new in this heaven."<br />
          <img
            src="https://c.tenor.com/Iytba-UF0EkAAAAM/angry-birds-puppy-eyes.gif"
            class="gifs"
          />
          <br />
          Girl smiled softly and said in a very sweet voice," You really have a
          very good sense of humour, I will help you, follow me." and she
          started walking. <br />
          William was confused he thought “What I am doing so humorous, everyone
          is complementing me the same. Whatever, I got someone who can help me,
          and whom I can trust." and he started following her. <br />
          <img
            src="https://c.tenor.com/gPhmuKT6BBQAAAAM/wait-a-minute-steve-harvey.gif"
            class="gifs"
          />
          <br />
          He just landed there, not knowing anyone and anything but still was
          convinced for no reason that the girl might help her in that
          situation, however that’s not our concern. I will tell you the story,
          you will read and enjoy my story and William will mess the story I
          think, but not right now he is just going with the flow, so why we
          will jump out of the box let us stay together and see what happens
          next.<br />
          The girl turned around and said, <br />
          <img

            class="gifs"
          /><br />
          And it happened, what was supposed to happen,<br />

          <br />
          William fainted........
